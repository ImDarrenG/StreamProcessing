# StreamProcessing
This project is me experimenting with Scala and various distributed stream processing tools, on rasp pi clusters

I will publish various projects, starting with driving a 3 x pi Kafka cluster ingesting data from a mock sensor.

Pi config setup to follow.

Also will beef this up a bit!
